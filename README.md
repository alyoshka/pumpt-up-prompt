# Bash profile
Inspired by [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and [agnoster theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes#agnoster). <br/>
Minimal and fast. Shows only current directory path + current Git branch along with the dirty state. <br/>
Also contains several aliases (most of them are from [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Cheatsheet)).
