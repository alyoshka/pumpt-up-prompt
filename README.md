# Bash profile
Inspired by [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and [agnoster theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes#agnoster). <br/>
Minimal and fast. Shows only current directory path + current Git branch along with the dirty state.

## Requirements
1. [Git completion and prompt plugins](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/completion) (git-completion.bash and git-prompt.sh)
2. [Menlo for Powerline font](https://github.com/abertsch/Menlo-for-Powerline)

## Installation
Copy `.bash_profile` to your root directory.
