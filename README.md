**Terminal**: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)<br/>
**Theme**: Solarized Dark<br/>
**Font**: Menlo PP12

## Installation
Prompt:

1. Copy `.pumpt-up-prompt.sh` to your root directory;
2. Include pumpt-up-prompt script to your `.bash_profile` by adding `[[ -f ~/.pumpt-up-prompt.sh ]] && . ~/.pumpt-up-prompt.sh` (or copy .bash_profile file from this repo).
    
Font (separators and icons):

1. Download your favorite font from the `Fonts` folder;
2. Choose a font depending on the font size you are using, ex. take Menlo PP13 if you are using 13pt font size in your terminal.

Git Prompt Plugin:

* Copy `git-prompt.sh` and `git-completion.bash` from [Git Prompt Plugin](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/completion) to your root folder;
    
\[Optional\] Install a better bash default configuration - [Sensible Bash](https://github.com/mrzool/bash-sensible).

## Configuration
Segments color and order are changed in 'Settings' block inside `.pumpt-up-prompt.sh`.

Segment | Description
------- | -----------
time    | Current time
user    | User name
host    | Host name
dir     | Directory
git     | Git branch (commit)
venv    | Activated Python virtual environment name
ssh     | SSH host name
screen  | Current screen name

## Terminals
Notes on using Pumpt up Prompt with different terminal emulators:

### iTerm
Pumpt up Prompt was originally developed for iTerm2, there should be no problems.

### Hyper
Hyper treats characters as a browser (which differs from how iTerm does it), so separators won't align perfectly. Fortunately, you can easily fix it by adding some CSS to Hyper settings (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>).<br/>
Start with this configuration:

    // custom css to embed in the terminal window
    termCSS: '.unicode-node { margin-left: -0.5px; overflow: hidden; }',

Add `line-height` (1.2em by default) and `font-size` (1em by default) changes if needed.

### Terminal.app
Terminal.app has a mechanism that changes color for the last prompt character (for better contrast probably). There is no way to disable this behavior. I suggest you try other emulators if that bothers you.
